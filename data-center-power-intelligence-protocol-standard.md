## Introduction

Modern computational workloads, particularly artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications, create unprecedented operational demands on data center infrastructure and electrical grid systems. AI training workloads can generate power fluctuations exceeding 200 MW within temporal intervals of 40 ms, creating grid-destabilizing events that threaten electrical system stability.

Traditional data center infrastructure operates reactively, responding to power and thermal events after occurrence, resulting in inefficient resource utilization, increased energy consumption, and reduced opportunities for renewable energy integration. The rapid adoption of high-power-density computational workloads necessitates a fundamental paradigm shift toward proactive, intelligence-driven infrastructure coordination.

This document establishes the Data Center Power Intelligence Protocol (DCPI), a comprehensive framework enabling real-time communication between computational workloads, infrastructure systems, and external utility networks. DCPI transforms data centers from passive power consumers into intelligent grid assets capable of providing demand response services, optimizing renewable energy consumption, and contributing waste heat to municipal district heating systems.

The protocol addresses three primary objectives: elimination of grid-destabilizing power events while enabling grid services participation; reduction of parasitic power consumption through predictive thermal management; and maximization of renewable energy utilization through intelligent workload scheduling coordinated with grid carbon intensity.
