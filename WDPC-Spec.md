# Workload Dynamic Power and Cooling (WDPC) 

## Introduction

Modern artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) workloads create unprecedented challenges for data center infrastructure coordination. AI training applications can generate power fluctuations exceeding 200 MW within 40 ms intervals, creating grid-destabilizing events equivalent to a quarter-million people suddenly appearing on the electrical grid.

Current data center infrastructure lacks consistent, coordinated mechanisms for moving critical operational data between workload management systems, power infrastructure, and cooling systems. This absence of standardized data interfaces creates information silos that prevent effective coordination and optimization across the complete workload-to-infrastructure pathway.

This Technical Specification establishes the Workload Dynamic Power and Cooling (WDPC) framework for standardized data movement and coordination between computational workloads and infrastructure systems. WDPC addresses the fundamental challenge of creating consistent, temporal data standards that enable intelligent coordination without prescribing specific control implementations.

The framework establishes three primary objectives: standardization of temporal data formats and metadata structures for power and cooling systems; creation of consistent instrumentation and monitoring interfaces across workload-to-infrastructure pathways; and enablement of coordinated optimization through standardized data availability rather than centralized control.

WDPC provides the foundational data infrastructure necessary for innovation in workload-infrastructure coordination while maintaining flexibility for diverse implementation approaches across traditional organizational boundaries.

## 1 Scope

This Technical Specification establishes the Workload Dynamic Power and Cooling (WDPC) framework for standardized data coordination between computational workloads and energy infrastructure systems. WDPC addresses the critical need for consistent temporal data standards in environments where artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications generate power fluctuations exceeding 200 MW within temporal intervals of 40 ms.

This specification covers:

a) **temporal data standards and formats** for power consumption, thermal generation, and cooling system performance with standardized metadata and tagging structures;

b) **instrumentation interface specifications** for monitoring and data collection across workload-to-infrastructure pathways including power distribution, cooling systems, and environmental sensors;

c) **data movement protocols** enabling consistent information flow between computational workloads, infrastructure management systems, and external utility interfaces;

d) **hierarchical data granularity frameworks** supporting different resolution requirements from component-level monitoring to facility-level reporting;

e) **metadata and tagging standards** for temporal data sources enabling coordinated optimization without prescriptive control implementations;

f) **security frameworks** for critical infrastructure data communications.

This specification is applicable to data centers with power capacities from 1 MW to 1,000 MW requiring coordinated workload and infrastructure data management for:

— cloud computing workloads;  
— high-performance computing applications;  
— AI/ML training and inference operations;  
— edge computing deployments.

This specification focuses on data standardization and movement rather than control system implementation. It does not prescribe:

— specific control algorithms or optimization strategies;  
— electrical safety standards for high-voltage systems (see IEC 61936 series);  
— mechanical design specifications for cooling system components (see ASHRAE standards);  
— grid interconnection control requirements (see IEEE 1547 series).

a) **temporal data requirements** determining appropriateness of time-series databases versus traditional relational approaches;

b) **system scale** influencing choice between centralized and distributed data coordination approaches;

c) **security requirements** affecting data access patterns and authentication mechanisms;

d) **integration complexity** with existing building management systems and external utility interfaces.

### B.3 Training and certification

Organizations implementing WDPC should develop training programs covering:

a) **temporal data analysis** and metadata management techniques;

b) **instrumentation system operation** and data quality assessment;

c) **multi-system data correlation** and optimization interpretation;

d) **security procedures** for critical infrastructure data handling.

## Annex C (informative) — Environmental impact assessment

### C.1 Carbon footprint reduction potential

WDPC implementation can enable significant carbon footprint reductions through:

a) **improved data availability for renewable energy optimization** enabling 15% to 30% reduction in average grid carbon intensity;

b) **enhanced coordination for demand response participation** reducing fossil fuel peaker plant operation;

c) **standardized waste heat recovery data** supporting municipal heating system integration.

### C.2 Energy efficiency improvements potential

Expected energy efficiency improvements through coordinated data availability include:

a) **power usage effectiveness (PUE) improvements** of 0.1 to 0.3 through enhanced thermal management coordination;

b) **operational efficiency gains** of 15% to 25% through improved workload-infrastructure coordination;

c) **grid efficiency improvements** through enhanced load forecasting and demand response participation.

### C.3 Operational improvements

Data standardization enabled by WDPC can improve operational efficiency through consistent monitoring interfaces, reducing operational complexity for facility management staff while enabling coordinated optimization across multiple infrastructure domains.
