# Workload Dynamic Power and Cooling (WDPC) 

## Introduction

Modern artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) workloads create unprecedented challenges for data center infrastructure coordination. AI training applications can generate power fluctuations exceeding 200 MW within 40 ms intervals, creating grid-destabilizing events equivalent to a quarter-million people suddenly appearing on the electrical grid.

Current data center infrastructure lacks consistent, standardized mechanisms for distributing critical operational data between workload management systems, power infrastructure, and cooling systems. This absence of standardized data distribution interfaces creates information silos that prevent effective autonomous optimization across the complete workload-to-infrastructure pathway.

This Technical Specification establishes the Workload Dynamic Power and Cooling (WDPC) framework for standardized data distribution and autonomous coordination between computational workloads and infrastructure systems. WDPC addresses the fundamental challenge of creating consistent, temporal data standards that enable intelligent autonomous optimization through data availability rather than centralized control.

The framework establishes three primary objectives: standardization of temporal data formats and metadata structures for power and cooling systems through distributed messaging; creation of consistent data publication and subscription interfaces across workload-to-infrastructure pathways; and enablement of autonomous optimization through standardized data availability rather than prescribed coordination mechanisms.

WDPC provides the foundational data distribution infrastructure necessary for innovation in workload-infrastructure autonomous optimization while maintaining flexibility for diverse policy-driven implementation approaches across traditional organizational boundaries.

## Scope

This Technical Specification establishes the Workload Dynamic Power and Cooling (WDPC) framework for standardized data distribution between computational workloads and energy infrastructure systems. WDPC addresses the critical need for consistent temporal data standards in environments where artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications generate power fluctuations exceeding 200 MW within temporal intervals of 40 ms.

This specification covers:

a) **temporal data standards and formats** for power consumption, thermal generation, and cooling system performance with standardized metadata and data stream structures;

b) **data publication and subscription interfaces** for monitoring and data distribution across workload-to-infrastructure pathways including power distribution, cooling systems, and environmental sensors;

c) **message bus protocols** enabling consistent information flow between computational workloads, infrastructure management systems, and external utility interfaces through ticker-feed architectures;

d) **hierarchical data granularity frameworks** supporting different resolution requirements from component-level monitoring to facility-level reporting through multi-level data streams;

e) **metadata and data stream standards** for temporal data sources enabling autonomous optimization without prescriptive control implementations;

f) **security frameworks** for critical infrastructure data communications in distributed messaging environments.

This specification is applicable to data centers with power capacities from 1 MW to 1,000 MW requiring autonomous workload and infrastructure data management for:

— cloud computing workloads;  
— high-performance computing applications;  
— AI/ML training and inference operations;

This specification focuses on data standardization and distribution rather than control system implementation. It establishes data availability frameworks that enable policy-driven autonomous optimization. It does not prescribe:

— specific control algorithms or optimization strategies;  
— centralized coordination mechanisms or orchestrator implementations;
— electrical safety standards for high-voltage systems (see IEC 61936 series);

## Annex B (informative) — Implementation guidelines

### Phased deployment approach

WDPC implementation should follow a phased approach addressing the identified data streaming challenges in order of complexity, with particular emphasis on iterative development of message bus architectures based on performance requirements:

**Phase 1**: Basic temporal data streaming and standardization to establish consistent data publication across workload-to-infrastructure pathways using message bus implementations as primary approach

**Phase 2**: Performance evaluation and identification of access bottlenecks, particularly for AI applications requiring sub-second access times, with optimization of ticker symbol architectures for components where baseline approaches prove inadequate

**Phase 3**: Advanced autonomous policy deployment and metadata enhancement for multi-system coordination and analysis using optimized streaming patterns

**Phase 4**: External system data integration for grid services participation and municipal heat integration through standardized data streaming

### Message bus architecture selection methodology

Organizations implementing WDPC should evaluate message bus architectures using an iterative approach:

a) **baseline implementation** using standardized message bus patterns for all components to establish functional data streaming;

b) **performance assessment** identifying specific components and data types where access times cannot meet AI application requirements;

c) **selective optimization** of ticker symbol structures and streaming protocols for chassis monitoring and component-level data publication requiring sub-second access times;

d) **hybrid optimization** combining streaming patterns based on specific requirements, such as:
   - Message bus architectures for facility-level reporting and external system integration
   - High-frequency ticker feeds for node-level and component-level monitoring
   - Streaming protocols for continuous data flows between nodes and infrastructure systems

### Component identification and data stream definition

Organizations implementing WDPC should systematically identify data publication requirements:

a) **component mapping** following the hierarchical architecture from facility to component level based on Open Compute Project (OCP) monitoring frameworks;

b) **ticker symbol specification** for each component level including:
   - Node level: specific node power role, cumulative power meter, idle baseline power, peak load
   - Component level: individual processor power, memory subsystem characteristics, PSU/BBU performance
   - Chassis level: environmental metrics, sensors, assembly and control systems

c) **streaming pattern assignment** based on access time requirements and data frequency for each component type;

d) **alternative implementation identification** for components where baseline approaches prove inadequate for AI application requirements.

### Data architecture pattern selection

Organizations implementing WDPC should evaluate data architecture patterns based on:

a) **temporal data requirements** determining appropriateness of time-series streaming versus traditional storage approaches, with emphasis on sub-second data access capabilities;

b) **system scale** influencing choice between centralized and distributed data streaming approaches;

c) **AI application access requirements** affecting streaming protocol selection and data processing architectures;

d) **integration complexity** with existing building management systems and external utility interfaces.

### Policy framework deployment

Organizations implementing WDPC should develop policy frameworks covering:

a) **autonomous decision-making** policies for component-level optimization based on data stream inputs;

b) **data streaming governance** and ticker symbol management across multiple organizational units;

c) **component-level policy deployment** understanding autonomous optimization principles and policy conflict resolution;

d) **streaming architecture management** for different access time requirements and application needs;

e) **security procedures** for critical infrastructure data handling across distributed streaming and policy execution interfaces.

## Annex C (informative) — Environmental impact assessment

### Carbon footprint reduction potential

WDPC implementation can enable significant carbon footprint reductions through:

a) **improved data availability for renewable energy optimization** enabling 15% to 30% reduction in average grid carbon intensity through autonomous policy-driven decisions;

b) **enhanced autonomous participation in demand response** reducing fossil fuel peaker plant operation;

c) **standardized waste heat recovery data streaming** supporting municipal heating system integration.

### Energy efficiency improvements potential

Expected energy efficiency improvements through autonomous data-driven optimization include:

a) **power usage effectiveness (PUE) improvements** of 0.1 to 0.3 through enhanced thermal management coordination via streaming data;

b) **operational efficiency gains** of 15% to 25% through improved workload-infrastructure autonomous optimization;

c) **grid efficiency improvements** through enhanced load forecasting and autonomous demand response participation.

### Operational improvements

Data standardization enabled by WDPC can improve operational efficiency through consistent data streaming interfaces, reducing operational complexity for facility management staff while enabling autonomous optimization across multiple infrastructure domains without centralized coordination overhead.

## Annex D (informative) — Standard ticker symbols

### Core infrastructure ticker symbols

WDPC implementations should support the following standard ticker symbols as minimum requirements:

**Table D.1 — Standard power monitoring ticker symbols**

| Ticker Symbol | Description | Units | Update Frequency |
|---|---|---|---|
| WDPC.PWR.TOTAL | Total facility power consumption | MW | 100 ms |
| WDPC.PWR.IT | IT equipment power consumption | MW | 100 ms |
| WDPC.PWR.COOLING | Cooling system power consumption | MW | 1 s |
| WDPC.PWR.GRID | Grid power draw | MW | 100 ms |
| WDPC.PWR.ONSITE | On-site generation | MW | 100 ms |

**Table D.2 — Standard thermal monitoring ticker symbols**

| Ticker Symbol | Description | Units | Update Frequency |
|---|---|---|---|
| WDPC.THM.INLET | Cooling system inlet temperature | °C | 1 s |
| WDPC.THM.OUTLET | Cooling system outlet temperature | °C | 1 s |
| WDPC.THM.AMBIENT | Ambient temperature | °C | 1 s |
| WDPC.THM.FLOW | Coolant flow rate | L/min | 1 s |

| WDPC.ENV.RENEWABLE | Renewable energy percentage | % | 15 min |
| WDPC.ENV.DEMAND | Demand response status | boolean | 1 min |

### Custom ticker symbol guidelines

Organizations may define custom ticker symbols following the naming convention:

`WDPC.[CATEGORY].[SUBCATEGORY].[IDENTIFIER]`

Where:
- CATEGORY: PWR, THM, ENV, WKL, INFRA
- SUBCATEGORY: Domain-specific grouping
- IDENTIFIER: Specific measurement or signal

Custom ticker symbols should include metadata specifying units, accuracy, and update frequency to ensure proper autonomous policy implementation.
