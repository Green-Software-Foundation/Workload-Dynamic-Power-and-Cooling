# Workload Dynamic Power and Cooling (WDPC) - Vx.y

## Introduction

Modern artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) workloads create unprecedented challenges for data center infrastructure coordination. AI training applications can generate power fluctuations exceeding 200 MW within 40 ms intervals, creating grid-destabilizing events equivalent to a quarter-million people suddenly appearing on the electrical grid.

Current data center infrastructure lacks consistent, standardized mechanisms for distributing critical operational data between workload management systems, power infrastructure, and cooling systems. This absence of standardized data distribution interfaces creates information silos that prevent effective autonomous optimization across the complete workload-to-infrastructure pathway.

This Technical Specification establishes the Workload Dynamic Power and Cooling (WDPC) framework for standardized data distribution through a central data bus architecture that connects all system components directly. WDPC addresses the fundamental challenge of creating consistent, temporal data standards that enable intelligent autonomous optimization through high-performance data availability rather than centralized control.

The framework establishes three primary objectives: implementation of a central data bus architecture where all components connect directly for bidirectional data flow; standardization of Protocol Buffer (protobuf) data models and serialization for high-performance temporal data exchange; and enablement of marketplace-style frameworks for energy, carbon, and workload optimization through standardized data availability.

WDPC provides the foundational data bus infrastructure necessary for innovation in workload-infrastructure autonomous optimization while supporting marketplace frameworks for energy trading, demand response, and sustainability optimization.

## Scope

This Technical Specification establishes the Workload Dynamic Power and Cooling (WDPC) framework for standardized data distribution through a central data bus architecture. WDPC addresses the critical need for high-performance temporal data standards in environments where artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications generate power fluctuations exceeding 200 MW within temporal intervals of 40 ms.

This specification covers:

a) **central data bus architecture** enabling direct bidirectional connections between all system components including workloads, infrastructure, sensors, and external systems;

b) **Protocol Buffer (protobuf) data models** providing high-performance serialization with 2-6x faster processing and 30-70% smaller message sizes compared to JSON-based approaches;

c) **hierarchical component data models** supporting standardized data definitions from facility-level down to individual component monitoring with consistent schema evolution;

d) **marketplace framework integration** enabling energy trading, carbon optimization, and demand response coordination through standardized data availability;

e) **temporal data streaming protocols** supporting sub-100ms data publication requirements for AI workload optimization;

## General requirements

### Central data bus architecture

The WDPC system shall implement a central data bus architecture where all components connect directly to a shared data ring, eliminating hierarchical communication patterns and enabling bidirectional information flow between all system participants. This architecture addresses the critical insight from technical discussions that workloads must interface directly with the data bus rather than through server intermediaries, ensuring that sensors from racks and individual components have direct representation on the data ring.

#### Data bus core infrastructure

The central data bus shall provide high-performance messaging infrastructure utilizing:

a) **Protocol Buffer serialization** achieving 2-6x faster processing and 30-70% message size reduction compared to JSON-based alternatives, following Google's proven methodology for defining serialized data on message buses as discussed in architectural reviews;

## External system integration

### Grid operator integration

#### Grid data protobuf schemas

Grid operator integration shall utilize standardized protobuf messages for bidirectional communication:

```protobuf
message GridOperatorData {
  string grid_operator_id = 1;             // Utility identifier
  google.protobuf.Timestamp timestamp = 2; // Data timestamp
  GridStatus current_status = 3;           // Real-time grid state
  repeated GridForecast forecasts = 4;     // Forward-looking data
  DemandResponseRequests dr_requests = 5;  // Load management requests
  
  RenewableGenerationStatus renewables = 16; // Clean energy status
  map<string, double> grid_parameters = 17; // Grid characteristics
}

message GridStatus {
  double system_frequency_hz = 1;          // Grid frequency
  double carbon_intensity_g_co2_kwh = 2;  // Real-time carbon intensity
  double renewable_percentage = 3;         // Clean energy mix
  GridStabilityIndicator stability = 4;    // System stability
  repeated RegionalPricing pricing = 5;    // Energy pricing data
}

enum GridStabilityIndicator {
  STABLE = 0;
  MODERATE_STRESS = 1;
  HIGH_STRESS = 2;
  EMERGENCY = 3;
}
```

### Municipal utility integration

#### Municipal heat integration

Municipal heat recovery systems shall implement protobuf data exchange:

```protobuf
message MunicipalHeatData {
  string municipal_system_id = 1;          // Municipal system identifier
  google.protobuf.Timestamp timestamp = 2; // Data timestamp
  HeatDemandForecast demand = 3;          // Municipal heat demand
  HeatQualityRequirements quality = 4;     // Quality specifications
  HeatDeliveryCapacity capacity = 5;       // System capacity
  
  DistrictHeatingNetwork network_status = 16; // Network operational state
  map<string, double> pricing_structure = 17; // Heat pricing data
}

message HeatQualityRequirements {
  double supply_temperature_min_c = 1;     // Minimum supply temperature
  double supply_temperature_max_c = 2;     // Maximum supply temperature
  double return_temperature_max_c = 3;     // Maximum return temperature
  repeated string contaminant_limits = 4;  // Water quality limits
}
```

## Security requirements

### General security framework

WDPC implementations shall implement security measures conforming to IEC 62443-3-3 for industrial communication networks, addressing critical infrastructure protection in high-performance protobuf messaging environments.

### Protobuf message security

#### Message authentication

All protobuf messages shall include authentication through:

a) **Digital signatures** using X.509 certificates embedded in message metadata;

b) **HMAC-SHA256** integrity verification for all temporal data transmissions;

c) **Message sequence numbering** preventing replay attacks in high-frequency data streams;

d) **Timestamp validation** ensuring message freshness within acceptable time windows.

#### Schema security

Protobuf schema management shall ensure:

a) **Schema registry authentication** requiring mutual TLS for schema updates;

b) **Schema versioning integrity** preventing unauthorized schema modifications;

c) **Access control lists** limiting schema access based on component roles;

d) **Schema validation** ensuring only authorized protobuf definitions are deployed.

---

## Test methods

### Protobuf performance testing

#### Serialization performance verification

Protobuf implementations shall be tested for:

a) **Serialization speed benchmarking** achieving sub-10ms encoding for critical data streams;

b) **Deserialization performance** meeting sub-5ms decoding requirements for component data;

c) **Memory efficiency testing** validating optimal memory usage patterns;

d) **Cross-language compatibility** ensuring consistent performance across implementation languages.

#### Data bus performance testing

Data bus implementations shall validate:

a) **Message throughput testing** achieving 1+ million messages per second capabilities;

b) **End-to-end latency measurement** validating sub-100ms data distribution;

c) **Schema evolution testing** ensuring backward/forward compatibility during updates;

d) **Fault tolerance validation** maintaining data integrity during component failures.
