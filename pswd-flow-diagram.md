## PSWD Flow Diagram

**Four Primary Layers:**

1. **Workload Interface Layer** - Handles communication from AI training, inference, HPC, and traditional compute workloads
2. **Infrastructure Control Layer** - Coordinates power management, thermal systems, and battery storage
3. **External Integration Layer** - Manages grid operator communication and municipal utility integration
4. **Hardware Abstraction Layer** - Provides standardized interfaces for BMCs, sensors, and power meters


**Key Features Highlighted:**

- **Sub-second response times** (100ms power monitoring, 250ms battery coordination)
- **High accuracy requirements** (±0.5% power measurement, ±0.1°C temperature)
- **Grid integration** with IEC 61850-90-4 compliance for demand response
- **Municipal heat integration** for waste heat recovery (70-90°C)
- **Security framework** with IEC 62443-3-3 compliance
- **Time synchronization** with ±1ms accuracy using NTP/PTP


The diagram uses color coding and different line styles to show:

- **Solid animated lines** for primary data flows
- **Dashed lines** for hardware monitoring connections
- **Dotted lines** for security and time synchronization
