> **Standardized data coordination between computational workloads and energy infrastructure**

## Problem

AI workloads create **200+ MW power swings within 40ms**, destabilizing electrical grids. Current data centers lack consistent data movement mechanisms for coordinated workload-infrastructure optimization.

## Solution

WDPC provides standardized temporal data formats and interfaces enabling intelligent coordination without prescriptive control implementation.

**Key Capabilities:**
- 🕐 **Temporal Data Standards** - 100ms resolution with metadata tagging
- 🔌 **Infrastructure Coordination** - Power, thermal, and grid data integration  
- 🌱 **Renewable Optimization** - Carbon-aware workload scheduling data
- ♨️ **Heat Recovery** - Municipal heating network coordination
